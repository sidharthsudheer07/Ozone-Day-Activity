    <ul id="ol">
        <li>Avoid the consumption of gases dangerous to the ozone layer, due to their content or manufacturing process.
            Some of the most dangerous gases are CFCs (chlorofluorocarbons), halogenated hydrocarbon, methyl bromide and
            nitrous oxide.</li>
        <li>Minimize the use of cars. The best transport option is urban, bicycle, or walking. If you use a car to a
            destination, try to carpool with others to decrease the use of cars in order to pollute less and save.</li>
        <li>Do not use cleaning products that are harmful to the environment and to us. Many cleaning products contain
            solvents and substances corrosive, but you can replace these dangerous substances with non-toxic products
            such as vinegar or bicarbonate.</li>
        <li>Buy local products. In this way, you not only get fresh products but you avoid consuming food that has
            traveled long distances. As the more distance traveled, the more nitrous oxide is produced due to the medium
            used to transport that product.</li>
        <li> Maintain air conditioners, as their malfunctions cause CFC to escape into the atmosphere.</li>

    </ul>
