  <p>The ozone layer was discovered in 1913 by the French physicists Charles Fabry and Henri Buisson. Measurements of
    the sun showed that the radiation sent out from its surface and reaching the ground on Earth is usually consistent
    with the spectrum of a black body with a temperature in the range of 5,500–6,000 K (5,227 to 5,727 °C), except that
    there was no radiation below a wavelength of about 310 nm at the ultraviolet end of the spectrum. It was deduced
    that the missing radiation was being absorbed by something in the atmosphere. Eventually the spectrum of the missing
    radiation was matched to only one known chemical, ozone.[2] Its properties were explored in detail by the British
    meteorologist G. M. B. Dobson, who developed a simple spectrophotometer (the Dobsonmeter) that could be used to
    measure stratospheric ozone from the ground. Between 1928 and 1958, Dobson established a worldwide network of ozone
    monitoring stations, which continue to operate to this day. The "Dobson unit", a convenient measure of the amount of
    ozone overhead, is named in his honor.</p><br><br>
