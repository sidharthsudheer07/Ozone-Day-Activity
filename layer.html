    <h3 id="we">What is Ozone Layer?</h3>
    <br><br>
    <p>
        The ozone layer is a thin part of the Earth's atmosphere that absorbs
        almost all of the sun's harmful ultraviolet light. "Ozone holes" are
        popular names for areas of damage to the ozone layer.Most ozone resides in
        the stratosphere (a layer of the atmosphere between 10 and 40 km above
        us), where it acts as a shield to protect Earth's surface from the sun's
        harmful ultraviolet radiation. With a weakening of this shield, we would
        be more susceptible to skin cancer, cataracts and impaired immune systems.
        Ozone is a gas in the atmosphere that protects everything living on the Earth from harmful ultraviolet (UV) rays
        from the Sun. Without the layer of ozone in the atmosphere, it would be very difficult for anything to survive
        on the surface. (Think of a very bad sunburn, only much worse!) Plants cannot live and grow in heavy ultraviolet
        radiation, nor can the plankton that serve as food for most of the ocean life. The ozone layer acts as a shield
        to absorb the UV rays, and keep them from doing damage at the Earth's surface.
